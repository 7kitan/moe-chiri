This is probably my first experience writing online.
I don't have many ideas on what to write, but I think that writing about my life would be pretty interesting.
Not sure about how others would think about it though. (laughs)

I have always struggled to bring about something finished. It might be fear of wasting time and effort, or just plain perfectionism.
Many other times it has been trying to learn too many things at once, but eventually one has to pick their battles.

Generally, I would not like to post on social media, for the reason of (gestures broadly at everything in 2025).
I like posting on Bluesky, but sometimes the character limit breaks up my thoughts.
So now I'm essentially making my own TwitLonger that I can save as text files.

There are about a billion ways to make a blog website out there, and I have nearly burned myself out just considering between a dozen options.
You can make your own system, code your own themes, set up a content manager, and everything in between.

At the end, I decided to just grab something pre-made that is so minimal there can't be any fault with it. You can't criticise a website with only black text on white background...right?

Setting up this site took me around 2 hours to start and 2 days to figure out how to make Cloudflare Pages work. It's quite a bit of work but I'm pretty happy with how it's turned out right now.
